/**
 * Cross-browser/cross-PC credential storage: the encrypted credential bundle written to the Duet's
 * own SD card, so a different browser (or a different PC) hitting the same printer can load it
 * without re-entering every token from scratch - it just needs the same passphrase.
 *
 * This is a REAL widening of exposure versus browser-only storage: anyone who can reach the
 * printer's web UI, or physically pull the card, can reach this file - a browser profile requires
 * that specific device. Only the ciphertext lives here; the passphrase itself is never written
 * anywhere (see credentials.ts) and is still required to actually use whatever gets loaded from it.
 * The user chose this trade-off explicitly (2026-07 session) - it must stay opt-in, never automatic.
